# ATM-Project

My first semester project covering all the essentials of C++ with error handling and user friendly interface . This project allow user to use all basic functions of ATM

Main Key Points are
1- User Authentication (PIN)
2- Cash Withdrawal / Deposit
3- Proper security system 
4- Receipt Generation


The code Starts with a display menu which can also be seen in the picture down below  contains a user friendly diplay just like real ATM

After Entring the Pin  a interface pops up give us the four options  which are in the image down below

Upon entering the number of funtion you want to use either withdraw or deposit there is a limit and if you try to withdraw more money than limit or vice versa
it will return invalid amount and same goes for the balance in the account if you withdraw more money than ballance ammount
it will simply return invlaid

The reciept system is one of my favourite system in this project as its well structured and user friendly  
It displays the nessassery info required on any ATM reciept

After that comming towards security system if you add invalid PIN it will give you Two more tries.
And then your account will be locked

You can also check the code as given as real.cpp  
There are also some other details you can check it by yourself 
It is my first semester project might not be as perfect as professional but this project scored full when presented
